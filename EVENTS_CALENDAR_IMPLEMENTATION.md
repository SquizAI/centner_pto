- **Full Event Information**:
  - Title, description, date/time, location, campus
  - Event image with fallback
  - Event badges (campus, ticketed, RSVP required)
  - Time until event (e.g., "in 3 days")

### 4. Database Schema
The RSVP table includes:
```sql
event_rsvps (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  event_id UUID REFERENCES events(id),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  parent_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  parent_email TEXT NOT NULL,
  num_adults INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
  num_children INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  notes TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  UNIQUE(event_id, user_id)
)
```

### 5. UI Components

## Technical Implementation

### Next.js 15 App Router Patterns
- **Server Components**: Event detail page, related events
- **Client Components**: Interactive elements (calendar, dialogs, buttons)
- **Server Actions**: All mutations (RSVP create/delete)
- **Streaming**: Loading.tsx for instant feedback
- **Metadata API**: Dynamic OG tags for event pages

### Security & Validation
- **Zod Schemas**: All input validation
- **Row Level Security**: Supabase RLS policies
- **Auth Checks**: User ownership verification
- **Capacity Limits**: Automatic enforcement
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Database constraints

### Performance Optimizations
- **Memoization**: useCallback, useMemo for expensive operations
- **Indexes**: Database indexes on frequently queried columns
- **Image Optimization**: Next.js Image component
- **Code Splitting**: Dynamic imports where appropriate
- **Caching**: Server-side data fetching with revalidation

## Database Migrations Needed

Run the following migration to ensure the database is up to date:

```bash
# Apply the RSVP enhancement migration
supabase db push

# Or manually run:
# /supabase/migrations/20251016120000_enhance_event_rsvps.sql
```

The migration includes:
- RSVP table creation/enhancement
- Indexes for performance
- Row Level Security policies
- Helper functions (get_event_rsvp_count, get_event_total_attendees)

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Calendar View Testing
```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Navigate to http://localhost:5001/events
```

**Test Cases**:
1. **Calendar Navigation**
   - Switch between month, week, day, agenda views
   - Navigate to different months
   - Verify events display correctly in all views

2. **Filtering**
   - Filter by campus (Preschool, Elementary, Middle/High, All)
   - Filter by event type
   - Filter by month
   - Combine multiple filters
   - Clear filters individually or all at once
   - Verify filter count updates

3. **Event Interaction**
   - Click on calendar event → should navigate to detail page
   - Click on upcoming event in sidebar → should navigate to detail page
   - Verify "View Details" link appears on hover

### 2. Event Detail Page Testing

**As Guest User**:
1. Navigate to `/events/[some-event-id]`
2. Verify all event information displays correctly
3. Click "Add to Calendar" → test all three options
4. Click "RSVP Now" → fill form → submit
5. Verify error if trying to RSVP twice with same email

**As Authenticated User**:
1. Log in to the system
2. Navigate to an event detail page
3. Click "RSVP Now"
4. Verify form auto-fills with user name/email
5. Submit RSVP with guest count
6. Verify "You're Attending" badge appears
7. Click "Cancel RSVP" → confirm → verify removed
8. Test capacity limits by RSVP'ing to full event

**Past Events**:
1. Navigate to a past event
2. Verify "Past Event" badge shows
3. Verify RSVP button is disabled or hidden
4. Verify "Event has passed" message displays

### 3. RSVP Functionality Testing

**Create RSVP**:
```javascript
// Test data
{
  event_id: "valid-event-uuid",
  parent_name: "John Doe",
  parent_email: "john@example.com",
  num_adults: 2,
  num_children: 3,
  notes: "Dietary restrictions: vegetarian"
}
```

**Test Cases**:
1. Valid RSVP creation
2. Duplicate RSVP prevention
3. Capacity limit enforcement
4. Invalid email format
5. Missing required fields
6. Non-existent event ID

**Cancel RSVP**:
1. Create RSVP
2. Cancel RSVP
3. Verify RSVP count decreases
4. Verify can RSVP again after canceling

### 4. Calendar Export Testing

**Test Each Format**:
1. **Google Calendar**
   - Click Google Calendar option
   - Verify redirects to Google Calendar
   - Verify event details are correct

2. **Outlook**
   - Click Outlook option
   - Verify redirects to Outlook
   - Verify event details are correct

3. **Apple Calendar**
   - Click Apple Calendar option
   - Verify .ics file downloads
   - Open file → verify event imports correctly

### 5. Share Functionality Testing

1. **Email Share**
   - Click share button
   - Select "Share via Email"
   - Verify email client opens
   - Verify subject and body are formatted correctly

2. **Copy Link**
   - Click share button
   - Select "Copy Link"

   - Paste link → verify it works

### 6. Filter Testing

**Desktop**:
1. Filters show in left sidebar
2. Filter count updates as you select options
3. Active filters show as badges
4. Can remove individual filters via X button
5. "Clear All" button removes all filters

**Mobile**:
1. Filters hidden behind sheet
2. Filter button shows active filter count
3. Sheet slides up from bottom
4. All filter functionality works same as desktop

### 7. Performance Testing

1. **Load Time**
   - Calendar view loads in < 2 seconds
   - Event detail page loads in < 1 second
   - Filter changes apply instantly

2. **RSVP Speed**
   - RSVP submission completes in < 2 seconds
   - Optimistic UI updates

3. **Database Queries**
   - Check for N+1 queries
   - Verify indexes are being used
   - Monitor query execution time

## Known Issues / Limitations

1. **Event Type Detection**: Currently uses simple keyword matching in description. Consider adding dedicated `event_type` column to events table for better filtering.

2. **Timezone Handling**: Events stored in UTC. Consider adding timezone field for proper display across different timezones.

3. **Email Notifications**: RSVP confirmation emails not yet implemented. Requires email service integration (SendGrid, Resend, etc.).

4. **Waitlist**: No waitlist functionality for full events. Could be added in future update.

5. **Recurring Events**: No automatic RSVP migration for recurring events. Users must RSVP to each occurrence separately.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Email Notifications**
   - RSVP confirmation emails
   - Event reminder emails (24 hours before)
   - Cancellation notifications

2. **Calendar Sync**
   - Two-way sync with Google Calendar
   - Automatic updates when events change

3. **Check-in System**
   - QR code for event check-in
   - Attendance tracking
   - Print attendee list for admins

4. **Advanced Filtering**
   - Grade level filter
   - Date range picker
   - Search by keyword
   - Save filter preferences

5. **Social Features**
   - See who else is attending (optional)
   - Comment on events
   - Event ratings/feedback

6. **Analytics**
   - RSVP conversion rates
   - Popular event types
   - Campus engagement metrics
   - Export reports for board meetings

7. **Mobile App**
   - Push notifications for events
   - Faster RSVP flow
   - Offline mode

## Dependencies

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check this documentation first
2. Review the code comments in each file
3. Check Supabase dashboard for RLS policy issues
4. Review server logs for error details

## Conclusion

The events calendar system is now complete and production-ready. All core features have been implemented following Next.js 15 best practices with proper server/client component separation, server actions for mutations, and comprehensive error handling.

The system is fully responsive, accessible, and optimized for performance. Database migrations are provided and RLS policies ensure data security.
